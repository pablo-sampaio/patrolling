
WEB VIEWER OF THE SIMULATION

----------------------------

1) First, run the whole simulation. (It seems to work only with 5x5 grid graphs -- see TestSimpleMultiagentAlgorithm).

2) Save the results in "js\data.json". See class algorithms.rodrigo.SaveVisits .

3) Open "index.html" in Mozilla Firefox. (Doesn't work in Chrome anymore).

4) A player of the simulation starts in the web browser.
