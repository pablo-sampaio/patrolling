/**
 * Propagates through the edges (arcs) the attraction forces that are produced by the masses.
 * However, it is more complex than the "Edge" propagation because it forces all nodes to
 * contribute in the force of each edge (somewhat similar to the propagation "Node"). 
 * <br><br>
 * For each edge x->y, all nodes z (differente from x) produces an attraction force. The 
 * distance is computed as the addition of the length of x->y and the distance of the 
 * shortest path y->...->z.  
 * <br><br>
 * As in the other types of propagation, all forces in direction x->y are combined using 
 * one of the forces combinators (e.g. max or sum), which are implemented in subclasses of 
 * this class.
