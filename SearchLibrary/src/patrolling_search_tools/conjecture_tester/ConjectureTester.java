/**
 * This class can be used to test conjectures (unproved statements) about the optimal
 * solutions for the TMAP problem, with the <b>maximum interval</b> metric.
 * <p>
 * For instance, it can be used to test if: <ul>
 *  <li> in all optimal solutions in general graphs, the agents patrol disjoint parts of the graph (a <i>false</i> statement);
 *  <li> in all optimal solutions in "path" graphs, when the number of agents is below half the number of nodes, the (optimal) agents walks in disjoint parts of the graph (<i>true</i>);
 *  <li> in all optimal solutions in general graphs, the optimal maximum interval is always above <b>N/r</b>, where N is the number of nodes and r is the number of agents (<i>true</i>).
 * </ul>
 * To use this class, it is necessary to provide an implementation of the <b>Conjecture</b> 
 * interface to specify the specific property to be tested (e.g., one of those above). Then
 * this conjecture may be tested with one of the <i>testConjecture()</i> methods provided by
 * this class.
 * <p>
 * This class tests the conjecture by creating test cases (instances of the problem), then
 * using a search algorithm to find the optimal solution to that test configuration, and finally,
 * submitting these solutions to the Conjecture object to confirm or not the desired statement
 * in that instance. One failed case indicates that the conjecture is false. If all cases are
 * successful, it is considered "approved" in the tests. However, in this case, from a mathematical
 * standpoint, it cannot be said that the conjecture is true, indeed.  
 * <p>
 * If the conjecture is about restricted configurations of the problem (i.e., for specific graphs 
 * and numbers of agents) it is convenient to implement also the <b>TestsGenerator</b> interface, to 
 * generate only the instances that are relevant for the conjecture. 
 *
